            Mathematical Concepts
            <div class="mcon">
                <li>ALGEBRA: <br><i>Algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with <br> symbols and the rules for manipulating <br>those symbols. It involves studying mathematical symbols<br> and the rules for manipulating <br>these symbols </i></li>
                <li>CALCULUS: <br> <i>Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study <br>of rates of change and the accumulation of quantities. <br>It provides a framework for modeling and analyzing processes <br>that change over time or space.</i> </li>
                <li>DISCRETE MATHEMATICS: <br> <i>Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures <br>that are fundamentally discrete rather than <br>continuous. It includes topics such as graph theory,<br> combinatorics, logic, and set theory.</i></li>
                <li>PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS: <br> <i>Probability and statistics are branches <br>of mathematics that deal with uncertainty and <br>data analysis. </i></li>

        <div class="block2">
            Programming Concepts
            <div class="pcon">
                <li>ALGORITHMS: <br><i>Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas <br> for solving problems. They are a sequence of instructions <br>that describe how to perform<br> a computation or solve a problem.</i></li>
                <li>DATA STRUCTURES: <br><i>Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data<br> in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. <br>They define the layout and organization of data elements<br> in memory and provide operations<br> for accessing and manipulating the data.</i> </li>
                <li>OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING: <br> <i>Object-Oriented Programming is a programming <br>paradigm based on the concept of "objects", <br>which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes or properties), <br>and code in the form of procedures (methods). </i></li>
                <li>FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING: <br> <i>Functional Programming is a programming paradigm<br> that treats computation as the evaluation <br>of mathematical functions and avoids <br>changing state and mutable data.  </i></li>
